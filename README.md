# ImageMarker

ImageMarker is a tool for making splitting up a sequence of images up into different categories. It's useful for dividing up a big sequence of images taken from an SD card or your phone's camera.

The code was originally pulled from a private commercial project and was refactored to be published here. It can use some polishing.
